## Part 3
## Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold for 
## complete cases and calculates the correlation between sulfate and nitrate 
## for monitor locations where the number of completely observed cases (on all 
## variables) is greater than the threshold. The function should return a vector 
## of correlations for the monitors that meet the threshold requirement. If no 
## monitors meet the threshold requirement, then the function should return a 
## numeric vector of length 0. The function that you write should be able to match 
## the expected output. Please save your code to a file named corr.R. 
## 
## For this function you will need to use the 'cor' function in R which calculates 
## the correlation between two vectors. Please read the help page for this function 
## via '?cor' and make sure that you know how to use it.
