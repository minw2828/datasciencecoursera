## swirl Programming Assignment: 
## swirl is a software package that turns the R console into an interactive 
## learning environment. In this programming assignment, you'll have the 
## opportunity to earn up to 5 extra credit points while using swirl to 
## practice some key concepts from this course.
##
## 0. First things first
## You must have the most recent version of swirl to complete this assignment.
## swirl requires R 3.0.2 or later. If you have an older version of R, please 
## update before going any further. If you're not sure what version of R you 
## have, type R.version.string at the R prompt. If you are on a Linux operating 
## system, please visit our Installing swirl on Linux page for special 
## instructions.
## 
## 1. Install swirl
## Since swirl is an R package, you can easily install it by entering a single 
## command from the R console:
## install.packages("swirl")
##
## 2. Load and run swirl
## Every time you want to use swirl, just load the package and start the 
## program. From the R console:
## library(swirl)
## swirl()
##
## 3. Install the R Programming course
## swirl offers a variety of interactive courses, but for our purposes, you 
## want the one called R Programming. If this is your first time using swirl, 
## it will prompt you to install the R Programming course automatically. If 
## you've used swirl in the past, you will need to type the following from 
## the R prompt:
## install_from_swirl("R Programming")
##
## 4. Complete the lessons
## There are 15 lessons in the R Programming course covering a variety of 
## important topics. Each completed lesson is worth one extra credit point. 
## However, the maximum number of points you may earn for the assignment is 
## capped at 5. Regardless, these lessons will give you valuable practice and 
## you are encouraged to complete as many as possible. If you skip() more than 
## one question in a lesson, you will not receive credit for that lesson.
##
## 5. Get extra credit for your work!
## Upon completing each lesson, swirl will ask for your Coursera credentials:
## Course ID: rprog-030
## Submission login (email): The email address associated with your Coursera 
##                           account
## Submission password: This is NOT the password that you use to log into the 
##                      Coursera website. Your submission password can be found 
##                      at the top of the Programming Assignments page.
## Once you've entered and confirmed this information, swirl will attempt to notify 
## Coursera automatically. If something goes wrong with automatic submission, you'll
## have the option to retry or submit manually.
