## Question 11
## In the dataset provided for this Quiz, what are the column names of the dataset?
## 
## Question 12
## Extract the first 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does 
## the output look like?
## 
## Question 13
## How many observations (i.e. rows) are in this data frame?
##
## Question 14
## Extract the last 2 rows of the data frame and print them to the console. What does 
## the output look like?
##
## Question 15
## What is the value of Ozone in the 47th row?
## 
## Question 16
## How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?
## 
## Question 17
## What is the mean of the Ozone column in this dataset? Exclude missing values (coded 
## as NA) from this calculation.
## 
## Question 18
## Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp 
## values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?
## 
## Question 19
## What is the mean of "Temp" when "Month" is equal to 6?
##
## Question 20
## What was the maximum ozone value in the month of May (i.e. Month = 5)?

data$Ozone[47]

## Question 16
## How many missing values are in the Ozone column of this data frame?
length(which(is.na(data$Ozone)==TRUE))

## Question 17

## or 
mean(data$Ozone, na.rm=TRUE)

## Question 18
## Extract the subset of rows of the data frame where Ozone values are above 31 and Temp
## values are above 90. What is the mean of Solar.R in this subset?
