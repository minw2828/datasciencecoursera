## Practical Machine Learning Overview
## - there are lots of Machine Learning classes out there and 
##   they are usually very good
## - the primary focus of this course is hands on application 
##   of machine learning in R
## - take R packages and perform machine learning on those data
## - Cases when the applications work and cases that may be in 
##   trouble
## - resources to mathematics details and computational methods
