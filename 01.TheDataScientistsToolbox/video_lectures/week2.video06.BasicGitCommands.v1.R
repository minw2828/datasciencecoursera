## Branches 
## - Sometimes you are workign on a project with a version being used by many people
## - You may not want to edit that version
## - so you can create a branch with the command:
git checkout -b branchname
## - To see what branch you are on type:
git branch
## - to switch back to the master branch type
git checkout master

## Pull requests
## - If you fork someone's repo or have multiple branches, you'll both be working 
##   seperately
## - Sometimes you want to merge your changes into the other branch/repo
