## Dataset: Electric power consumption [20Mb]
## https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip
##
## Description: Measurements of electric power consumption in one household 
## with a one-minute sampling rate over a period of almost 4 years. Different 
## electrical quantities and some sub-metering values are available.
##
## The following descriptions of the 9 variables in the dataset are taken from 
## the UCI web site:
## 1. Date: Date in format dd/mm/yyyy
## 2. Time: time in format hh:mm:ss
## 3. Global_active_power: household global minute-averaged active power 
##    (in kilowatt)
## 4. Global_reactive_power: household global minute-averaged reactive power 
##    (in kilowatt)
## 5. Voltage: minute-averaged voltage (in volt)
## 6. Global_intensity: household global minute-averaged current intensity 
##    (in ampere)
## 7. Sub_metering_1: energy sub-metering No. 1 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
##    It corresponds to the kitchen, containing mainly a dishwasher, an oven and 
##    a microwave (hot plates are not electric but gas powered).
## 8. Sub_metering_2: energy sub-metering No. 2 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
##    It corresponds to the laundry room, containing a washing-machine, a 
##    tumble-drier, a refrigerator and a light.
## 9. Sub_metering_3: energy sub-metering No. 3 (in watt-hour of active energy). 
##    It corresponds to an electric water-heater and an air-conditioner. 
##
## Loading the data
##
## When loading the dataset into R, please consider the following:
## - The dataset has 2,075,259 rows and 9 columns. First calculate a rough 
##   estimate of how much memory the dataset will require in memory before 
##   reading into R. 
## - Make sure your computer has enough memory (most modern computers should be 
##   fine).
## - We will only be using data from the dates 2007-02-01 and 2007-02-02. One 
##   alternative is to read the data from just those dates rather than reading 
##   in the entire dataset and subsetting to those dates.
## - You may find it useful to convert the Date and Time variables to Date/Time 
##   classes in R using the strptime() and as.Date() functions.
## - Note that in this dataset missing values are coded as ?.
##
## Making Plots
##
## Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage varies 
## over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to reconstruct the following 
## plots below, all of which were constructed using the base plotting system.
##
## First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository: 
## https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1
##
## For each plot you should
## - Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480 pixels and 
##   a height of 480 pixels.
## - Name each of the plot files as plot1.png, plot2.png, etc.
## - Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the 
##   corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your 
##   code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be 
##   fully reproduced. You must also include the code that creates the PNG file.
## - Add the PNG file and R code file to the top-level folder of your git repository 
##  (no need for separate sub-folders)
## - When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to GitHub so 
##   that the GitHub version of your repository is up to date. There should be four 
##   PNG files and four R code files, a total of eight files in the top-level folder
##   of the repo.
## - The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below.

## Reviewing the Assignments
##
## - Keep in mind this course is about exploratory graphs, understanding the data, and 
##   developing strategies. Here's a good quote from a swirl lesson about exploratory 
##   graphs: "They help us find patterns in data and understand its properties. They 
##   suggest modeling strategies and help to debug analyses. We DON'T use exploratory 
##   graphs to communicate results."
##
## - The rubrics should always be interpreted in that context.
##
## - As you do your evaluation, please keep an open mind and focus on the positive. The 
##   goal is not to deduct points over small deviations from the requirements or for 
##   legitimate differences in implementation styles, etc. Look for ways to give points 
##   when it's clear that the submitter has given a good faith effort to do the project, 
##   and when it's likely that they've succeeded. Most importantly, it's okay if a person 
##   did something differently from the way that you did it. The point is not to see if 
##   someone managed to match your way of doing things, but to see if someone objectively 
##   accomplished the task at hand.
##
## To that end, keep the following things in mind:
##   DO
## - Review the source code.
## - Keep an open mind and focus on the positive.=/li>
## - When in doubt, err on the side of giving too many points, rather than giving 
##   too few.
## - Ask yourself if a plot might answer a question for the person who created it.
## - Remember that not everyone has the same statistical background and knowledge.
##
##   DON'T:
## - Deduct just because you disagree with someone's statistical methods.
## - Deduct just because you disagree with someone's plotting methods.
## - Deduct based on aesthetics.
