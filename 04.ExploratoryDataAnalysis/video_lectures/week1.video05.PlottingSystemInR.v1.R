## Plotting Systems in R

## The Base Plotting System:
##   - "Artists palette" model
##   - Start with blank canvas and build up from there
##   - Start with plot fucntion (or similar)
##   - Use annotation functions to add/modify (text, lines, points, axis)
##
## Features:
##   > Convenient, mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
##   < Cannot go back once plot has started (i.e. to adjust margins); need 
##     to plan in advance 
##   < Difficult to "translate" to others once a new plot has been created 
##     (no graphical "language")
##   < Plot is just a series of R commands
##
## Example of Base Plot
library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist)) 

## The Lattice System: 
##   - Plots are created with a single function call (xyplot, bwplot, etc.) 
##   > Most useful for conditioning types of plots: Looking at how y changes 
##     with x across levels of z
##   > Things like margins/spacing set automatically because entire plot is 
##     specified at once
##   > Good for putting many many plots on a screen
##   < Sometimes awkward to specify an entire plot in a single function call
##   < Annotation in plot is not especially intuitive 
##   < Use of panel functions and subscripts difficult to wield and requires 
##     intense preparation
##   < Cannot "add" to the plot once it is created
## 
## Example of Lattice System:
library(lattice)
state <- data.frame(state.x77, region=state.region)
xyplot(:ife.Exp~Income | region, data=state, layout=c(4,1))

## The ggplot2 System: (recommend)
##   - Splits the difference between base and lattice in a number of ways 
##   - Automatically deals with spacings, text, titles but also allows you to
##     annotate by "adding" to a plot
##   - Superficial similarity to lattice but generally easier/more intuitive 
##     to use
##   - Default mode makes many choices for you (but you can still customize 
##     to your heart's desire)
##
## Example of The ggplot2 System: 
library(ggplot2)
data(mpg)
qplot(displ, hwy, data=mpg)

## Summary
## Base:    "artists palette" model
## Lattice: Entire plot specified by one function; conditioning
## ggplot2: Mixes elements of Base and Lattice
## Note: The above three systems are NOT interchangeable.
