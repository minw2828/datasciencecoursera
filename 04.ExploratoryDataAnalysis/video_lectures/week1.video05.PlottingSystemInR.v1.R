## Plotting Systems in R

## The Base Plotting System:
##   - "Artists palette" model
##   - Start with blank canvas and build up from there
##   - Start with plot fucntion (or similar)
##   - Use annotation functions to add/modify (text, lines, points, axis)
##
## Features:
##   > Convenient, mirrors how we think of building plots and analyzing data
##   < Cannot go back once plot has started (i.e. to adjust margins); need 
##     to plan in advance 
##   < Difficult to "translate" to others once a new plot has been created 
##     (no graphical "language")
##   < Plot is just a series of R commands
##

## Base Plot
library(datasets)
data(cars)
with(cars, plot(speed, dist))
