## Principles of Analytic Graphics

## 6 Basic Principles
##
## Principle 1: Show comparisons
##   - Evidence for a hypothesis is always RELATIVE to another competing hypothesis
##   - Always ask "Compare to what"?
##   e.g. boxplot compares control group and treatment group.
##
## Principle 2: Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systematic structure
##   - What is your causal framework for thinking about a question?
##   i.e. Ask why, and provide evidences that coporate the hypothesis and go against
##        the hypothesis.
##        Note: Data background (i.e. metadata) in this case is important.
## 
## Principle 3: Show multivariate data
##   i.e. Show as much detail in a single plot as possible.
##   - Multivariate = more than 2 variables
##   - The real world is multivariate 
##   - Need to "escape flatland"
##   e.g. plot(Daily PM10 ~ Daily casuality) shows a negative relationship, which is 
##        against expectation. But when plot(Daily PM10 ~ Daily casuality over 4 seasons), 
##        i.e. slit the data into 4 seasons and plot the data by season individually, it 
##        shows a slightly increase correlation in all seasons.
## 
## Principle 4: Show Integration of evidence
##   - Completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams
##   - Data graphics should make use of many modes of data presentation
##   - Don't let the tool drive the analysis
##   e.g. Nice example: Integrate graph, text, table, caption into one plot.
##
## Principle 5: Describe and document the evidence with appropriate labels, scales, sources, 
##              etc.
##   - Preserve the code that makes the plot
##   - A data graphic should tell a complete story that is credible
##   
## Principle 6: Content is king
##   - Analytical presentaitons ultimately stand or fall depending on the quality, relevance,
##     and integrity of their content
